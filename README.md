# NAME

MaxMind::DB::Reader::XS - Fast XS implementation of MaxMind DB reader

# VERSION

version 1.000003

# SYNOPSIS

    my $reader = MaxMind::DB::Reader->new( file => 'path/to/database.mmdb' );

    my $record = $reader->record_for_address('1.2.3.4');

# DESCRIPTION

Simply installing this module causes [MaxMind::DB::Reader](https://metacpan.org/pod/MaxMind::DB::Reader) to use the XS
implementation, which is much faster than the Perl implementation.

The XS implementation links against the
[libmaxminddb](http://maxmind.github.io/libmaxminddb/) library.

See [MaxMind::DB::Reader](https://metacpan.org/pod/MaxMind::DB::Reader) for API details.
